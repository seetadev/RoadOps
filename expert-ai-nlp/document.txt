Road safety continues to be a major developmental issue, a public health concern and a leading cause of death and injury across the world, killing more than 1.35 million globally as reported in the Global Status report on Road Safety 2018 with 90% of these casualties taking place in the developing countries and 11% alone being accounted for by India.As per the Report on Road accidents in India 2019, the accident related deaths in India in 2019 were 1,51,113 in number. It is indeed a matter of great concern that despite the continuing efforts of the Government in this regard and our commitments for halving fatalities we have not been able to register significant progress on this front.Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has been taking multiple initiatives including those related to vehicular and road engineering as well as educational measures for raising awareness in the field of Road Safety. The year 2019 saw the culmination of our efforts in the field of Road safety through the enactment of the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act 2019, which among other things, provides for a stiff hike in penalties for traffic violations with the aim of bringing in discipline and a responsible attitude amongst road users .I believe that the countrywide implementation of the MVA 2019 act, in its true spirit , will mark the turning point in road related deaths in the country .MESSAGETransport Bhawan, 1, Sansad Marg, New Delhi - 110 001Office Tel.: +91-11-2331522, 23715159 Fax : +91-11-23718568, website-www.morth.nic.in
Road accidents continue to be a leading cause of death, disabilities and hospitalization in the country despite our commitment and efforts. India ranks first in the number of road accident deaths across the 199 countries and accounts for almost 11% of the accident related deaths in the World.As per the Road Accident Report for 2019, a total number of 449,002 accidents took place in the country  during  the  calendar  year  2019leading  to  151,113  deaths  and  451,361  injuries.  In percentage terms, the number of accidents decreased by 3.86 % in 2019over that of the previous year, while the accident related deaths decreased by 0.20 % and the  persons injured decreased by 3.86. The decline in road accidents, killings and injury reported during the calendar year 2019 appear to have been a result of the Motor Vehicle Act implemented in States from September Ist 2019 which focused on road safety and included, inter-alia, stiff hike in penalties for traffic violations as well as electronic enforcement.The other trends noted in 2019 were very similar to those recorded in the previous years. National Highways which comprise of 2.03 percent of total road network, continued to account for a disproportionate  share  of  35.7  per  cent  of  deaths  in  2019  pointing  to  need  for  improved enforcement and correctives to be put on National Highways. State Highways which account for 3.01% of the road length accounted for 24.8 percent of deaths. Other Roads which constitute about 95 % of the total roads were responsible for the balance 39% deaths respectively, and electronic monitoring of the same.Like in the previous years, the working age group of 18 â€“ 60 accounted for a share of 84 percent in the total road accident deaths. Under the category of Traffic Rule Violations, over speeding continued to be a major killer even in 2019, accounting for 67% of the persons killed followed by driving on the wrong side of the road which accounted for 6% of the accident related deaths. Road traffic accidents are amenable to remedial actions and the Ministry has been  implementing a multi-pronged road safety strategy based on Education, Engineering (both of roads and vehicles), Enforcement and Emergency Care as detailed in Chapter 9 of the Report.In 2019, the Ministry focused on the identification and rectification of Black spots and identified 5583 black spots in the country in 2018.The identification of these Black Spots has been a critical intervention and has helped MORTH focus and plan out its rectification efforts.  The matter is being reviewed in a systematic manner with a portal being prepared for it and the progress being reviewed at the highest level periodically.fxfj/kj vjeus] fxfj/kj vjeus] vkbZ-,-,l-vkbZ-,-,l-fxfj/kj vjeus] vkbZ-,-,l-lfpolfpolfpoGIRIDHAR ARAMANE, GIRIDHAR ARAMANE, I.A.S.I.A.S.GIRIDHAR ARAMANE, I.A.S.SecretarySecretarySecretarylM+d ifjogu vkSj jktekxZ ea=ky;Ministry of Road Transport & HighwaysHkkjr ljdkj @ Government of IndiaRoom No. 509, Transport Bhawan, 1 Parliament Street, New Delhi-110 001, India Tel.: 91-11-23714104, Fax : 91-11-23356669E-mail: secy-road@nic.in Web : http://www.morth.nic.in

The Ministry is further working on implementing the Integrated Road Accidents (IRAD) Project under World Bank Assistance to provide a systemic solution to problem of accidents in line with international practice.  Basically, the IRAD will enable capture of road accidents and geotagging of the same through a tablet provided to the first responder which is the police.  The software of the project would provide back end analytics, as well  as simultaneous linkage with multiple users (as in  Hospitals,  ambulance,  Blood  Banks,  Vahan,  Sarathi,  NHAI,  PWD,  Courts,  Insurance Companies etc.), near real time syncing and updation of data base as well as development of a mobile application for Road accidents.  It is hoped that the data on different facets of road accidents and analysis contained in this Report will be useful to policy makers in States /UTs as well as for other stake holders.New DelhithDate: 24  September 2020GiridharAramane            ()lM+d ifjogu vkSj jktekxZ ea=ky;Ministry of Road Transport & HighwaysHkkjr ljdkj @ Government of India
