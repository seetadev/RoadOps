# C√≥digo Platform

C√≥digo is an AI-Powered Code Generation Platform for blockchain developers and web3 teams that saves development time and increases the code's security across various blockchains.

## Getting started

- You can immediately start using [C√≥digo Studio](https://studio.codigo.ai). C√≥digo Studio is a web-based IDE environment that comes with all the tools and programs to develop Solana programs using the CIDL.
- You can work from your local environment by downloading the latest version of the [C√≥digo CLI](https://github.com/Codigo-io/platform/releases) that targets your operating system. After downloading, put the C√≥digo CLI in your preferred location and add this location to your environment PATH.

## CIDL Quickstart

In this Quickstart guide, you‚Äôll learn how to start with C√≥digo‚Äôs Interface Description Language (CIDL) by building a simple Solana counter program.

> If you are following along from your local environment, this guide assumes you have successfully installed and configured the Solana tool suite. If you are working from C√≥digo Studio, you don‚Äôt need to worry; the Solana tool suite comes installed and configured. 

### 1. Counter Contract
Create a `counter.yaml` file and copy and paste the following CIDL.

```yaml
cidl: "0.8"
info:
  name: counter
  title: Counter
  version: 0.0.1
  license:
    name: Unlicense
    identifier: Unlicense
types:
  GreetingAccount:
    fields:
      - name: counter
        type: u32
methods:
  - name: increment
    inputs:
      - name: greeting_account
        type: GreetingAccount
        solana:
          attributes: [mut, init_if_needed]
  - name: decrement
    inputs:
      - name: greeting_account
        type: GreetingAccount
        solana:
          attributes: [mut, init_if_needed]
```

### 2. Generate the Solana program and client library

Open the terminal and type the following command

```shell
codigo solana generate counter.yaml
```

After generating the Solana program and client library, two new directories will be created relative to the `counter.yaml` file named `program_client` and `program`.

### 3. Implement the business logic

In the `program` directory, you will find a directory called `src`; inside this directory, there will be two `.rs` files named `increment.rs` and `decrement.rs`

#### Increment business logic

Copy and paste the following code just below the comment line `// Implement your business logic here...` in the file `increment.rs`

```rust
greeting_account.data.counter += 1;
```

#### Decrement business logic

Copy and paste the following code just below the comment line `// Implement your business logic here...` in the file `decrement.rs`

```rust
greeting_account.data.counter -= 1;
```

### 4. Build and deploy the program

Open the terminal and navigate to the `program` directory, from there execute the following command:

```shell
cargo build-sbf
```

Run a local Solana validator by opening a new terminal and typing the command:

> Don‚Äôt close this terminal because it is required for the following steps

```shell
solana-test-validator
```

Deploy the program by opening a new terminal and navigating to the `program` directory; from there, execute the following command:

```shell
solana program deploy target/deploy/counter.so
```

After deploying the program, you will receive the program id; copy and paste it somewhere for later.

### 5. Test your contract

Create a new file named `app.ts` inside the directory `program_client` and copy and paste the following code into the `app.ts` file:

> Replace the ‚ÄúPASTE_YOUR_PROGRAM_ID‚Äù with the program id you got when deploying the Solana program.

```typescript
import {decrementSendAndConfirm, getGreetingAccount, incrementSendAndConfirm, initializeClient} from "./index";
import {Connection, Keypair, PublicKey} from "@solana/web3.js";
import * as fs from "fs/promises";
import * as path from "path";
import * as os from "os";

async function main(feePayer: Keypair) {
    // TODO: Specify the smart contract Program Id we saved from when we deploy the smart contract
    const progId = new PublicKey("PASTE_YOUR_PROGRAM_ID");

    // Create a new Solana connection
    const connection = new Connection("http://127.0.0.1:8899");

    initializeClient(progId, connection);

    // 0. Create keypair for the Greeting account
    const greetingAccount = Keypair.generate();

    // 1. Increment the counter by 1
    await incrementSendAndConfirm({
        signers: {
            feePayer,
            greetingAccount
        }
    });
    let account = await getGreetingAccount(greetingAccount.publicKey);
    console.info(account);

    // 2. Decrement the count by 1
    await decrementSendAndConfirm({
        signers: {
            feePayer,
            greetingAccount
        }
    });
    account = await getGreetingAccount(greetingAccount.publicKey);
    console.info(account);
}

fs.readFile(path.join(os.homedir(), ".config/solana/id.json"))
.then(file => main(Keypair.fromSecretKey(new Uint8Array(JSON.parse(file.toString())))));
```

Open the terminal, navigate to the `program_client` directory, and execute the following commands:

```shell
npm install ts-node --save-dev
```

Finally, to run the test, execute the following command:

```shell
npx ts-node app.ts
```

After the execution completes, you should receive the following output:

```shell
{ counter: 1 }
{ counter: 0 }
```

## Next steps

**Congratulations!** üéâüëè you created your first Solana smart contract using the CIDL and integrated the generated TypeScript client library with an application. To summarize what we learned:

- CIDL stands for C√≥digo Interface Description Language, and it is the input for C√≥digo‚Äôs Generator.
- After completing the CIDL, developers only need to concentrate on implementing the business logic of the smart contract. 100% of the client libraries and smart contracts boilerplate are automatically generated.
