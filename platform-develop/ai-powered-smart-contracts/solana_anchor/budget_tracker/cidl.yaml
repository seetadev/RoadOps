  summary: |-
    The purpose of this contract is to track the income and outcome of a given user. For this contract, we are going to 
    target the Solana blockchain. Thus, we define the data structure **Record** that will be transpiled to a PDA Account 
    based on the seeds defined in the solana extension. In addition, the contract defines three methods, also known as 
    instruction; through this method, we add behavior.
