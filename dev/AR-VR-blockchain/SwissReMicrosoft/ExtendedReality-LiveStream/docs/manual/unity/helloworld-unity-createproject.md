# Creating a new Unity project

Go to the Unity [archive page](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) and download the latest 2018.4 version or 2019.4 version. Other Unity versions might work, but are not officially supported and have not been explicitly tested.

Create a new Unity project by selecting the 3D Template and choosing a project name and location. Unity will create several folders at that location, the most important of which is the `Assets` folder. This contains all source files for the project, and this is where the MixedReality-WebRTC Unity integration will be installed.
