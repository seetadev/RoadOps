# C# library overview

The C# library `Microsoft.MixedReality.WebRTC` provides a wrapper over the native C library of MixedReality-WebRTC, offering a more C# oriented API with familiar constructs such as `Task` and the `async` / `await` keywords.

There are currently two different tutorials:

- The [.NET Core 3.0 tutorial](helloworld-cs-setup-core3.md) for the Windows Desktop platform builds a console application which records audio and video.
- The [UWP tutorial](helloworld-cs-setup-uwp.md) for the Windows Universal Platform builds a graphical application with a XAML-based UI.
