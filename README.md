Transport DAO is an analytics and incident management platform for citizens, police officers and drivers to report and manage incidents, detect and prevent accidents on both mobile and web in a secure and simplified manner.Â With a mix of intelligent hardware, software on SAP Hana Database, Solana blockchain network with decentralized database, we provide intelligent feedback about drive quality and help analyze past incidents, as well as predict future incidents, enable road safety counseling.  Further, we enable private payments for vehicle repair on Solana using Elusiv sdk and nft voting for the service providers using daos.

Features:

1. 360 degrees access: Command and control centers can manage the complete lifecycle of incident reporting, overall status, enable early stage prevention of accidents and road safety counseling, management of workforce at the incident site.

2. Incident Dashboard: Manage and track your incidents  as a citizen along with sharing reviews and comments. Incident reporting, severity analytics and sentiment analysis using social media data for early stage detection and prevention of incidents. 

3. Real Time Alerts and Live Streaming: Real time alerts and live streaming using open source streaming project for incident verification and quick action.

4. Real Time Analytics: Analytics of the incidents with sentiment analysis and live incident reporting.  road safety eco-system. Health summary of the police staff, scheduling the staff. Reducing misinformation.


Blockchain Eco-system:

a. Solana Information Explorer: We are using Solana Multicurrency web wallet and information explorer with data analytics powered by SocialCalc for managing information and payments to emergency service providers, maintenance and repair servicemen and also insuarnce and cab aggregator providers for availing their services. SocialCalc with Solana explorer enables tabulation, data organization and management, is an easy-to-use analysis tool that summarises core data and features of a Token or NFT such as chains used, origin, issuer, energy consumption, and minting method.  We also enable private payments for vehicle repair on Solana using Elusiv sdk and nft voting for the service providers using daos.

Multi currency web wallet is very helpful in cases where the road incident involves tourists or foreign diplomats.

# NFT creation and minting on Solana

We are also developing an NFT creation and minting system on Solana for NFC tags of automobiles: please visit https://github.com/seetadev/RoadOps/tree/main/mint-nfts-solana/solana-nft-diy


# Content distribution using Solana:

1. Audio: We are extending and adapting the Audius layer on the Solana ecosystem to enable audio based streaming of an incident event. We are using the lighthouse SDK for storage.

2. Video: We are developing on the Huddle01 application layer and creating a bridge with the Solana blockchain to enable video conferencing and streaming on-chain. We are utilizing IPFS and Filecoin for storage purposes. We also plan to use Aptos along with Livepeer for developing a video command and control center and make it available via a bridge network.


# Wormhole Cross Chain Borrow and Lend dapp module

Usage of Wormhole Solana SDK: Please visit https://github.com/seetadev/RoadOps/tree/main/wormhole-crosschain-module/wormhole-solidity-sdk

Wormhole Cross Chain Borrow Lend at https://github.com/seetadev/RoadOps/tree/main/wormhole-crosschain-module/wormhole-cross-chain-borrow-lend

Wormhole cross chain interoperability between Solana and Cosmos

1. Wormhole Solana and Canto bridge enables us to have a DAO infrastructure with minimal gas fees. That is very important both from the privacy and cost effectiveness front.

2. Using Wormhole, Cosmos interoperability with Solana and Ethereum like blockchains. Also, ability to use decentralize NFT voting for incident investigative system.

3. Ability to generate NFT and ease of identity management.

4. We are generating an NFT for NFC tags for drones and UAVs and spare parts at the time of service and repair workflows.

5. Analytics tooling for visualization, tabulation, collaboration and organization of data.

5. Identity management, ability to extend the solution using IBC and reducing misinformation at the time of Incident analysis and reporting are the key reasons for experimenting with Canto.
Overall, Canto enables investigative case management and incident reporting, identity management at the time of allocation of a case to a police officer, incident severity analysis based on the decentralize voting at the IBC chain.



b. Algorand blockchain:  We are developing a rental and subscription marketplace using Algorand's NFT marketplace for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and analytics/visualization powered by Ethercalc (SocialCalc) for better coordination and immediate action. Please visit: https://github.com/seetadev/RoadOps/tree/main/dev/Algorand-nft-subscription-contracts

Algorand blockchain: Decentralized NFT-based subscription and voting system for contract work for service & maintenance providers and companies and Traffic Control. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work. We are also developing an NFT creation, subscription and minting system on Algorand: please visit https://github.com/seetadev/RoadOps/tree/main/dev/algorand
