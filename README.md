# NFT creation and minting on Solana

We are also developing an NFT creation and minting system on Solana for NFC tags of automobiles: please visit https://github.com/seetadev/RoadOps/tree/main/mint-nfts-solana/solana-nft-diy


# Content distribution using Solana:

1. Audio: We are extending and adapting the Audius layer on the Solana ecosystem to enable audio based streaming of an incident event. We are using the lighthouse SDK for storage.

2. Video: We are developing on the Huddle01 application layer and creating a bridge with the Solana blockchain to enable video conferencing and streaming on-chain. We are utilizing IPFS and Filecoin for storage purposes. We also plan to use Aptos along with Livepeer for developing a video command and control center and make it available via a bridge network.


b. Algorand blockchain:  We are developing a rental and subscription marketplace using Algorand's NFT marketplace for enabling sharing of government assets like toll prepaid card, car details information for interstate travel, driving license management and quarterly pollution check and analytics/visualization powered by Ethercalc (SocialCalc) for better coordination and immediate action.
