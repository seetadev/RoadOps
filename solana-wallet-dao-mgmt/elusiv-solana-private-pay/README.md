# Private payments on Solana using Elusiv SDK

## Setup:

1. Install the Elusiv SDK from the provided tarball[^1]. (do not install the unzipped package, this will mess up the path resolution for node): 

`npm i path/to/elusiv-sdk-1.0.0.tgz`

2. Install the other dependencies:

`npm i`

3. Generate a private key (don't use a real one) and copy paste it into [`src/contants.ts`](https://github.com/elusiv-privacy/elusiv-samples/blob/main/src/constants.ts). Fund it with some devnet SOL if you want to try out the topup and sending.

(In case you don't know how to generate/format the private key, there's a helper in [`src/boilerplate.ts`](https://github.com/elusiv-privacy/elusiv-samples/blob/main/src/boilerplate.ts) you can call)

# Usage:
Call the sample you want to execute using:

`npm run <sample name>`

Currently available samples: `topup`, `send`, `txFetching`. (This README might get out of date at some point, so the topmost authority of what samples exist is still the code in `src`)

[^1]: The SDK is currently in private beta. Contact us via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elusivprivacy) or [Discord](http://discord.gg/elusivprivacy) to request access.
