# Building from sources (Android)

The MixedReality-WebRTC library for Android takes the form of an Android archive (`.aar`). This archive is built using the scripts located in `tools/build/libwebrtc` and `tools/build/android`, in that order.

TODO - More detailed steps. See various README.md in those folders in the meantime.
