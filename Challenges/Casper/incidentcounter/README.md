Casper  (AXA â€“ Impact Token): 
We are using ERC-20 developer library to generate Master (an impact ERC-20 fungible Casper token) and also using Casper smart contracts eco-system to develop a counter for road incidents reported by citizens and complains resolved by police authorities in a specific region which could be shared across citizens and government authorities. Our impact token for citizens create a positive societal behavior and can be used for availing tax benefits, citizen rewards and ecommerce gift cards by Ministry of Road and Transportation.
