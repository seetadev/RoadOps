## Whitepapers

1. [Hello World](01_hello_world.md)
   - A simple network of contracts that use Wormhole generic messaging to send an arbitrary message, which any of the registered contracts can consume.
2. [Hello Token](02_hello_token.md)
   - A simple network of contracts that use Wormhole's token bridge contracts to perform cross-chain token transfer with an arbitrary payload (contract-controlled transfers) which any of the registered contracts can consume.
3. [NFT Burn Bridging](03_nft_burn_bridging.md)
   - An example for bridging NFTs of a Metaplex NFT collection from Solana to an EVM chain that burns the NFT on Solana, transmits the relevant information via Wormhole, and then remints the equivalent ERC721 NFT on the recipient EVM chain.
